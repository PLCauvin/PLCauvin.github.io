I am a PhD student at [Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble](https://www.liglab.fr/fr) in the [GHOST](https://ghost-team.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) team and at [Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann](https://www-ljk.imag.fr/) in the [DAO](https://dao-ljk.imag.fr/) group, under the supervision of [Panayotis Mertikopoulos](https://polaris.imag.fr/panayotis.mertikopoulos/) and [Jérôme Malick](https://membres-ljk.imag.fr/Jerome.Malick/).

My research interests lie at the intersection between game theory, optimization and probability. More precisely, I study the long-run behaviors of some game-theoretic learning algorithms (such as Follow-The-Regularized-Leader) and gradient based methods (such as gradient flows or mirror descent algorithms) when the underlying systems are subject to random perturbations and uncertainty.
