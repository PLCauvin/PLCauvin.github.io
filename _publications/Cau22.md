In this work, we derive an Edgeworth expansion for the Bernoulli weighted mean $$\hat{\mu} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i T_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n}$$ in the case where $$Y_1, \dots, Y_n$$ are i.i.d. non semi-lattice random variables
and $$T_1, \dots, T_n$$ are Bernoulli distributed random variables with parameter $$p$$. We also
define the notion of a semi-lattice distribution, which gives a more geometrical equivalence
to the classical Cramér’s condition in dimensions bigger than 1. Our result provides a
first step into the generalization of classical Edgeworth expansion theorems for random
vectors that contain both semi-lattice and non semi-lattice variables, in order to prove
consistency of bootstrap methods in more realistic setups, for instance in the use case of
online AB testing.
