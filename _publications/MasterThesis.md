In this work, we examine the robustness of game dynamics in the presence of
random shocks and disturbances to the underlying system. Expanding on the
microfoundations of evolution by imitation, we propose a class of stochastic
imitation dynamics, and we examine the model’s long-run behavior as a function
of the imitation protocol and the magnitude of the stochastic perturbations
affecting the system. In particular, we derive a set of sufficient conditions that
guarantee the extinction of dominated strategies and the asymptotic stability
of Nash equilibria (with probability 1 and high probability respectively), as
well as rates at which convergence occur. In a subsequent part, we also explain
how our results can be extended to cover a stochastic variant of the exponential
dynamics, which contain several important variants of the stochastic replicator
dynamics, now unified under the same general framework.
